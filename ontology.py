        "short_description": "Multiple unauthorized login attempts on an EC2",
        "description": "Multiple unauthorized login attempts were detected on an EC2 instance during late-night hours. The instance, critical for processing financial transactions, experienced login attempts from IP addresses 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 at 3 AM and 4 AM respectively. Historical data reveals a pattern of increased unauthorized access attempts during similar hours, indicating a potential targeted attack. The organization needs to investigate the source of these attempts, understand the intent, and ensure the instance's security without disrupting ongoing financial processes.",
